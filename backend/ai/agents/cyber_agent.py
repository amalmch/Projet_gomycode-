"""Cybersecurity agent for the OT network.

Before Step 8 this agent flagged **every** ``CYBER_EVENT`` as HIGH with no rules and hardcoded
defaults (`attempts=47`). It now classifies the event against named rules, attributes each one to
a MITRE ATT&CK for ICS technique **looked up in the published STIX bundle** (never from memory),
and — the part that matters most — when it concludes a sensor is lying it tells the risk engine to
**distrust** that sensor rather than ignore it.

That last behaviour is the one place where one agent changes how another reasons:
``OT-CYBER-PB §4`` requires that a spoofed reading be down-weighted, not discarded, so a machine
overheating is still detected when its own ambient sensor has been pinned low by an attacker. The
decision is written into ``state.agent_logs`` as "Distrust <sensor_id>" so it is visible on the
multi-agent page.

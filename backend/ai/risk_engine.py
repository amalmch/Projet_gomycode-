"""Risk engine: how confident are we, how bad is it, and what should be dealt with first.

Replaces the provisional fusion that lived in ``recommendation_agent`` (and, before Step 1, the
hardcoded 0.94 / 0.95 / 0.96 literals). Three jobs:

**1. Confidence — noisy-OR over independent sources, weighted by trust.**

``confidence = 1 - Π(1 - cᵢ · trustᵢ)``

Two weak but independent sensors agreeing is stronger evidence than either alone, and no finite
amount of evidence reaches certainty. ``trustᵢ`` defaults to 1.0 and is lowered for a sensor the
cyber agent judges to be spoofed (Step 8), which is what lets an overheating stay detected even
when its own temperature sensor is lying.

**2. Severity — impact × likelihood, capped by what the sensors actually justify.**

Impact comes from the asset's criticality, +1 if people are exposed, +1 for a hazard class that
hurts people directly (fire, overpressure). Likelihood is a band of the fused confidence. The
product picks a severity — but it is then **capped one band above the strongest single source**,
so the system cannot announce CRITICAL while every sensor is merely at a warning level. That cap
is what produces the honest WARNING → CRITICAL progression as a fault develops.

**3. Priority — what a human should look at first:** severity, then people exposed, then how
little time is left (ETA to a limit).

Everything returned carries its own arithmetic so the incident text can show the numbers rather
than assert them.

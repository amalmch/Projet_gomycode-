"""Inbound side of the n8n bridge (Engineer 1).

Three endpoints n8n calls back on, plus two read-only helpers for debugging and the demo:

* ``POST /api/ai/n8n/enrichment/{incident_id}`` — the LLM's explanation and its chosen action
  ids. Ids are validated against ``ai/actions_catalog.py``; risk levels and the
  "needs a human" flag are taken from the catalogue, never from the request body.
* ``GET  /api/ai/n8n/verify/{incident_id}`` — did the authorised actions actually change the
  plant? Used by the workflow to decide RESOLVING vs ESCALATED.
* ``POST /api/ai/n8n/status/{incident_id}`` — the workflow's final verdict.
* ``GET  /api/ai/n8n/state`` / ``GET /api/ai/n8n/state/{incident_id}`` — what the bridge knows.

Nothing here is required for detection. If n8n never calls, incidents keep the deterministic
recommendations created at detection time.

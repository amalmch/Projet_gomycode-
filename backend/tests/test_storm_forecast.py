"""The predictive scenario: a forecast, a prepared plant, and a storm that causes nothing.

Every other scenario in this suite is reactive - something is already too hot, too smoky or
already talking to a rogue device. This one is the opposite: the hazard is still in the future,
so the tests here care about three things the reactive tests cannot check.

1. The confidence is **derived from the forecast probability**, not from a severity label, and it
   never reaches certainty, because a forecast is a probability.
2. The incident is raised with a **lead time**, and the four preparation actions are the ones the
   catalogue actually allows for that hazard.
3. The outcome of the storm **depends on what was authorised**: with load shedding and the lower
   setpoint in place the surge stays inside the margin; without them it does not. That contrast is
   the whole argument of the scenario, so it is asserted in both directions.
